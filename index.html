          <p class="quote">Isn't that fantastic? We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.

          <p class="quote">Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. There we go. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. I like to beat the brush. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. This piece of canvas is your world. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

          <p class="quote">Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Have fun with it. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You need the dark in order to show the light. Anything you want to do you can do here. There we go. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Every highlight needs its own personal shadow. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>
